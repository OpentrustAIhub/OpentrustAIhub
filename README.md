Where Is It?

Where Is It? is a privacy-first, AI-powered spatial mapping and item tracking application designed to help individuals and organizations manage their physical belongings with precision, security, and ease. By leveraging LiDAR technology and artificial intelligence, this project creates a digital system for tracking and locating items without compromising user privacy.

Vision

The goal of Where Is It? is to create a world where managing physical spaces and belongings is simple, efficient, and privacy-conscious. By combining LiDAR’s 3D spatial mapping capabilities with conversational AI, users can seamlessly locate and organize their items while ensuring their data remains secure and non-intrusive.

Imagine walking into a room, scanning it with your phone’s LiDAR sensor, and tagging items digitally. Later, when you ask, “Where’s my screwdriver?” the app responds with its last known location, mapped onto a 3D model of the room.

Key Features

1. Privacy-Centric Mapping
	•	Uses LiDAR technology to scan and map spaces without capturing visual imagery.
	•	Stores only structural data (lines, shapes, and depth) rather than identifiable images.
	•	No invasive video or photo tracking—just geometric data.

2. AI-Assisted Organization
	•	Recognizes and tags objects using AI for easy tracking.
	•	Offers suggestions for optimizing storage and organization based on usage patterns.

3. Voice Query System
	•	Natural language queries like “Where is my hammer?” return the item’s last known location.
	•	Integrates with smart assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant) for hands-free functionality.

4. Visual Enhancements
	•	Provides a 3D room map where items are labeled and categorized.
	•	Allows users to “color in” their maps for creative or practical purposes.

5. Multi-User Collaboration
	•	Shared inventories for families, coworkers, or project teams.
	•	Ensures everyone in a shared space knows where items are stored.

6. Accessibility and Scalability
	•	Compatible with LiDAR-enabled devices (e.g., iPhones, iPads).
	•	Manual tagging options available for devices without LiDAR.

How It Works
	1.	Scan Your Space: Use your LiDAR-enabled device to create a 3D map of your room or workspace.
	2.	Tag Items: Assign tags to objects by pointing at them during the scan or uploading their metadata.
	3.	Query the System: Ask questions like “Where is [item]?” to locate tagged objects instantly.
	4.	Update Locations: Rescan spaces or manually update tags when items are moved.

Use Cases
	•	Home Organization: Track and manage belongings in cluttered spaces.
	•	Workspaces: Keep tools and supplies organized in workshops, studios, or offices.
	•	Small Businesses: Manage inventories for retail, warehouses, or hospitality services.
	•	Creative Applications: Use LiDAR for artistic or cinematic renderings of spaces.
	•	Accessibility: Assist users with disabilities or memory challenges in locating items.

Technology Stack

Hardware Requirements
	•	LiDAR-enabled devices (e.g., iPhone Pro, iPad Pro, AR devices).
	•	Optional: Smart home devices or IoT cameras for enhanced tracking.

Software
	•	LiDAR APIs: Apple ARKit, Microsoft Azure Kinect, or open-source alternatives.
	•	AI Models: OpenAI for natural language processing and object recognition.
	•	3D Rendering: Libraries like Three.js or Unity for visualizing spaces.
	•	Storage: Firebase, AWS, or local storage for spatial data and item metadata.

Development Roadmap

Phase 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
	•	LiDAR-based room scanning.
	•	Manual item tagging and basic location retrieval.
	•	Simple text-based queries (e.g., “Where is the vase?”).

Phase 2: Advanced AI Integration
	•	Object recognition for automated tagging.
	•	Voice command functionality.
	•	Drag-and-drop interface for updating item locations.

Phase 3: Collaboration and Scalability
	•	Multi-user inventory sharing.
	•	Storage optimization suggestions using AI.
	•	Cloud integration for optional data backup.

Challenges and Solutions
	•	Hardware Accessibility: Provide manual tagging options for users without LiDAR devices.
	•	Privacy Concerns: Ensure only non-identifiable spatial data is stored, with encryption for sensitive information.
	•	Data Size: Optimize LiDAR data storage with compression techniques.
